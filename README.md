# 🛡️✨ AI-Powered Online Safety App for Children & Parents
# 👶🧠 Purpose-Driven AI for a Safer Digital Childhood

This project focuses on building an AI-powered web extension and mobile safety application designed to protect underage users during their online activities. Whether they're exploring social media, chatting on roulette-style platforms, watching videos, or playing games, our solution ensures their digital safety and emotional well-being.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The Digital Dangers Facing Children

Children are increasingly exposed to online threats:

- üë§ **66%** of kids chat daily with strangers online ‚Äî risking deepfakes and grooming.
- üí¨ **12%** of parents report adults trying to befriend their children online.
- üéÆ **54%** of kids encounter violent content ‚Äî some at risk of photosensitive epilepsy.
- üìπ Deepfakes make fake audio/video harder to detect during cam interactions.
- üéÆ **Most online games** are not approved by safety regulations, unlike AAA games.
- üì± Kids aged 8‚Äì12 spend **5.4 hrs/day**, teens **8.2 hrs/day** online ‚Äî often unsupervised.

> **Aigis** is our AI-powered browser extension and dashboard to detect threats and protect families in real time, utilizing **Python**, **Django**, **JavaScript**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Deep Learning (DL)**.

## üß† Key Features

- üîç **AI-Powered Chat Supervision**: Utilizes **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** models like **RoBERTa (Transformers)** and the **Gemini API** to detect predator-like behavior, offensive language, hate speech, and other harmful patterns in text messages. Keywords: `text-classification`, `nlp`, `chat-analysis`, `content-moderation`.
- üßë‚ÄçüöÄ **Fake Profile & Deepfake Detection**: Employs **deep learning (TensorFlow/Keras)** and **computer vision (OpenCV, Ultralytics)** techniques for deepfake analysis in images/videos and behavior pattern scanning to identify suspicious profiles.

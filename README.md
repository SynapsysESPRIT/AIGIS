## ⚠️ The Digital Dangers Facing Children

Children are increasingly exposed to online threats:

- 👤 **66%** of kids chat daily with strangers online — risking deepfakes and grooming.
- 💬 **12%** of parents report adults trying to befriend their children online.
- 🎮 **54%** of kids encounter violent content — some at risk of photosensitive epilepsy.
- 📹 Deepfakes make fake audio/video harder to detect during cam interactions.
- 🎮 **Most online games** are not approved by safety regulations, unlike AAA games.
- 📱 Kids aged 8–12 spend **5.4 hrs/day**, teens **8.2 hrs/day** online — often unsupervised.


> **Aigis** is our AI-powered browser extension and dashboard to detect threats and protect families in real time.
